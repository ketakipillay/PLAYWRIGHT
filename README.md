#Playwright Automation Framework

This repository contains a test automation framework based on Playwright, a Node.js library that enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps.

**Features** : 

- Cross-browser testing: Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

- Parallel Test Execution: Run tests concurrently for better performance.

- Screenshots and Videos: Automatically capture screenshots and videos for failing tests.

- Fixtures and Hooks: Setup and teardown your tests easily with Playwrightâ€™s fixtures.

- Custom Reporter: Configured for better reporting of test results.

- Headless or Headed Modes: Run in both headless (faster) and headed (visual) modes.

 **Running Tests**
 
    To execute tests, you can use the following commands:
  
  - Run All Tests
    
    `npx playwright test`
  - Run Tests in a Specific Browser
    
    ` npx playwright test --project=chromium
      npx playwright test --project=firefox
      npx playwright test --project=webkit`
    
   - Run Tests in Headed Mode
   
      `npx playwright test --headed`
     
  -  Run a Specific Test File
    
      `npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts`
          
  -  Run Tests with UI Reporter
    
      Playwright comes with a built-in interactive test report that can be launched using:
      
      `npx playwright show-report`

      
 Test Reports
  - HTML Report: After each test run, an HTML report will be generated in the playwright-report directory. 
     You can open this report in a browser to inspect detailed test results.
  - Screenshots and Videos: Playwright automatically captures screenshots and videos for failed tests, which are available in the test-results folder.
       
        `npx playwright show-report`

      
 
  

**Configuration**

The Playwright configuration file playwright.config.ts contains various settings for:

- Browser configurations (e.g., Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Test directory paths
- Global timeout for tests
- Base URL for tests
- Headless mode
- Parallel execution
  
You can modify these settings according to your project requirements.

**Troubleshooting**
-Stale Element Reference Error: Ensure that the elements are stable before interacting with them using Playwright's wait functions.
-Timeouts: Playwright automatically retries and waits for elements, but you can adjust the timeout in the playwright.config.ts file.
